Sometimes you want to change the font size without changing the window 
geometry. This plugin tries to set the 'guifont', 'columns', and 'lines' to 
appropriate values in order to achieve this goal. You can define modes to 
quickly switch between your favourite gui configuration: fonts, window 
position and size, guioption settings etc.
